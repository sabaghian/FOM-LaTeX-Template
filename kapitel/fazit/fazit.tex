\section{Conclusion}
Both introduced models in this work show a correlation between monetay and fiscal ploicies and house price. An expansionary monetary policy will lead to a heigher house price as well as higher GDP. As the analytical can be used to understand the economy, they usually cannot hand quantative or accurate results for every country. Since, every country has its own economic system, in my opinion, that is better to make sure the used model presents the real system accurately or identify a model from data. For model identification one needs to make sure that the data used for the identification process contains enough information about dynamics of the system. In my opinion a combination of both approaches should be used for an accurate and reliable modeling of the system.
