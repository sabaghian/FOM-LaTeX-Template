\section{Conclusion}
Both introduced models in this work show a clear correlation between monetary and fiscal policies and house price.In short, an expansionary monetary policy leads to a higher house price and consequently higher GDP. Although analytical models can be used to understand the economy, they usually cannot hand in quantitative or accurate results for every country. Since every country has its own economic system, in my opinion, it is preferred to identify a model directly from data. For model identification one needs to make sure that the data used for the identification process contains enough information about dynamics of the system. In my opinion, a combination of both analytical and quantitative approaches should be used for an accurate and reliable modeling of the system.
