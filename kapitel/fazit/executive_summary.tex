\section*{Executive Summary}

Since Keynes published his book \enquote{ The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money}, the monetary and fiscal policies are used to stabilize the economies all over the world. A lot of research is conducted to clarify how these policies can affect different sectors of economy. In this work, we focus on the German housing market and  how it is related to monetary and fiscal policies. Firstly, we examine the monetary transition channels \footcite[See.][]{Mishkin1996} with the data from German economy from year 2000 t0 2020. Secondly, we use computational macroeconomics to identify a \ac{SVAR} model of the system. For this purpose we first choose a set of important variables which can affect the model. Then, under some reasonable assumptions a model is identified which represents the housing market related section of macroeconomics system of Germany in investigated years. Finally, this model is used to identify how every variable in model can affect the rest of the variables. At last, the shortcomings of this model are defined and some suggestions for the improvements in the future are given.
