\section{PM 1 vs PM 2} \label{PM2}

Some recent authors criticize the classical performance management methods. Colquitt ~\footcite[See. ][]{Colquitt2017} calls the classical performance management `PM 1` and he explains what should be stopped in `PM 1` and what needs to be started. He calls the new process `PM 2` which is a more updated version and more suitrable for modern life.
\subsection{Thinsgs To Stop}

PM 1 requires organizations to monitor performance and measure results. However, experiments show that the judtments are ususally affected with many factors and they are not accurate enough for such a process. Relative feedback is more damagaing in team work than constructive. It can lead to demotivation or even sabbotaging the teammates. Besides that, people are not always in full control of the situation and the uncontrollable factors can affect the performance measurements which has nothing to do with individual.~\footcite[See. ][]{Colquitt2017}

\subsubsection{Things To Start}

It is important for the companies to understand that they cannot buy commitment. If they really want their employees to commit they need to share the common belief and have a clear understanding of the objectives and the path to achieve them. They need to feel involved in something bigger than their everyday work. However, companies need to be careful with the weight they put on objectives since it can lead the a mentality of achieving a goal no matter the price. ~\footcite[See. ][]{Colquitt2017}
