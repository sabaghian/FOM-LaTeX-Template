@book{Colquitt2017,
Abstract = {There is no HR-related topic more popular in the business press than performance management (PM). There has been an explosion in writing on this topic in the past 5 years, condemning it as a failure and calling for fundamental change. The vast majority of organizations use the same basic process which I call “Last Generation Performance Management” or PM 1.0 for short. Despite widespread agreement that PM 1.0 is failing, few companies have abandoned it or made fundamental changes to it. While everyone agrees it is broken, few agree on how to fix it. Companies continue to tinker with their systems, making incremental changes every few years with no lasting improvement in effectiveness. Employees continue to achieve amazing things in organizations every day, despite this process not because of it. Nothing has worked because organizations, business leaders and HR professionals focus on PM practices instead of the fundamental purpose of PM and the paradigms, assumptions, and beliefs that },

@book{WorldAtWork2010,
Abstract = {While employers may be experiencing fewer attraction and retention troubles due to the most recent economic crisis, there is a strong business case for integrating rewards and talent management programs. Organizations that apply an integrated approach in this area and across all stages of the employment life cycle have an advantage in attracting, engaging and retaining the talent they need to succeed in their markets — and financially outperform their peers. And while almost any form of performance management can succeed (or fail), the key to success is how well the program is implemented and executed. In this collection of articles from WorldatWork, thought leaders provide ideas and concepts on how to create performance management programs that work. An effective performance management program is HR's'best opportunity to influence positive business results, and for that reason should be a priority for the entire human resources team.'},
